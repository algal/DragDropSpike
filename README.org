#+TITLE: DragDropSpike

It is straightforward to make a UIView draggable by attaching a
UIPanGestureRecognizer and implementing appropriate logic. However,
you usually want more than this.

This framework provides a bunch of related behaviors we take for
granted with desktop drag and drop. Namely, it provides the following:
- removing the dragged object from a "donor" object that originally contains it
- adding it to an "absorber" object on drop
- allowing the absorber to accept/reject the drop
- animating the dropped object back to its original position if the drop was rejected
- modifying its appearance to distinguish its picked-up from its put-down state
- conveying information from the donor to the absorber along with the drag and drop
- providing callbacks so the various objects can update their state
  and appearance appropriately during the drag and drop session.
